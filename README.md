# 🦀 Rust Data Structures & Algorithms

A collection of classic and modern **data structures** and **algorithms** implemented in **Rust**, for learning, experimentation, and performance comparison.

---

## 📚 Overview

This repository is a personal project to deepen understanding of Rust's ownership model, memory safety, and performance characteristics while implementing:

- ✅ Core data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.)
- ✅ Classic algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion, pathfinding, etc.)
- ✅ Advanced algorithms and techniques (DP, greedy, graph traversal, etc.)

---

## 🧠 Why?

Rust offers a unique blend of **performance, safety, and expressiveness**. This project helps:

- Reinforce low-level programming concepts
- Explore idiomatic Rust patterns
- Provide a reference for interviews and future Rust work
